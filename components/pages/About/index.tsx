      <p>Welcome to Unicornia!</p>

      <p>My name is Alena!</p>
      <p>All my life I lived in a huge noisy metropolis, but my soul always dreamed of the sea. And then my family and I decided to move to the small sunny town of Anapa. This city is located on the shores of the Black Sea and it is the best place for creativity!</p>

      <p>Here I started doing my favorite thing: creating plush sea animals and baby mobiles. I create it to give a touch of sea to families living far from the sea, but who love the sea with all heart.</p>
      <p>I live near the sea and it inspires me to create each of my toys. I put my love in them, fill them with care and a warm subtropical sun!</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m concerned about environmental pollution, so I sew my toys from natural fabrics only. Parents can be sure that their child is playing with an absolutely safe and environmentally friendly toy.</p>

      <p>I am very glad to create my marine toys for you. They will become your true friends!</p>

      <p>Love from Russia, Alena!</p>
